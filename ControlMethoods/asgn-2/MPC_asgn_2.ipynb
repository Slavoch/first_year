    "###  <font color=\"blue\"> 1.1 Intuition behind MPC </font>\n",
    "**MPC** is one of the most popular methods of obtaining the optimal controller and, in fact, is an industry standard.\n",
    "Let us start from the most reasonable question. Why should we care about **MPC**? Why do we even need that thing? Are there any problems that naturally lead to the development of such a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, yes. There are infinitely many applications of **MPC**, including petroleum extraction, agricultural facilities, automatic assembly and so on. But let us take a look at the development of such a type of machines that are impressive not only to an expert in the field - humanoid robots. If you've ever seen a video of Boston Dynamics' humanoid robots, you've probably wondered, how do the engineers made it work? How does such a complex machine make those precise movements so that it is capable of performing acrobatics that already exceeds the abilities of a typical human in some aspects (i.e. backflip)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is, you guessed it, **MPC**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of the modern robots comes with its cost. The problem of generating control for any robot requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "- real time performance, as there are in general almost no stable states in the robot's movement, and all the calculations should be performed quickly\n",
    "- optimizing a complex composite cost to a certain time horizon in order to follow the high-level plan\n",
    "- (in some cases) discrete-continuous optimization, which is difficult\n",
    "- taking into account various types of constraints, i.e.\n",
    "    1. torque and angle limits for the servomotors (in a form of inequality)\n",
    "    2. functional constraints following from the problem statement, that do not always allow for an analytical solution \n",
    "    3. also there could be constraints on foot placement, body placement, slippery surfaces, etc.\n",
    "    4. constraints of the limbs non-intersection (if this is a case)\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, such a problem could lack a closed form solution, like $\\boldsymbol u = \\boldsymbol f(\\text{state}, \\text{target})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental important ways to obtain an optimal controller is __MPC__. \n",
    "\n",
    "* __MPC-like algorithms__ are ones of the few that can handle very complex constraints, including functional, nonlinear, nonconvex, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally speaking, algorithms that generate control for a complex dynamical system typically have to be predictive. And taking the system model into account helps along the way. In order to optimize an objective along the trajectory, we could try to estimate the system behaviour in the future. This is litearlly what **MPC** does. With that in hand, let us state the problem and the **MPC** more formally.\n",
